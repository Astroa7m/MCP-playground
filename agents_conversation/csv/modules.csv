M348,Applied statistical modelling,8,"This 30 point level 3 module is designed to build on the statistical modelling taught at L1 (in M140) and L2 (in MT248).  Whilst M348 is intended to be a replacement for M346 Linear statistical modelling, it will have a new focus and serve a broader range of students. The main statistical theme running throughout M346 is that of linear and generalised linear modelling. These statistical modelling techniques are widely used by statisticians and are of utmost importance to anyone modelling and analysing large and complex datasets. In M348 the software package will be R. R is a popular statistical software package used around the world in academia and in industry, particularly by data scientists. R is a command line based package and hence is associated with steeper learning curve than GUI-based packages such as GenStat. To mitigate this it is planned to mediate the use of R through Jupyter notebooks. These electronic documents allow executable R code to be embedded amongst explanatory text. Furthermore this executable code can either be set to be modifiable by students,   enabling them to learn by adapting examples, or to be locked (and if desired hidden) thus not distracting students with code extraneous to a teaching point but nevertheless required. Also by providing a means for students to present results and conclusions alongside the code used to generate them they provide a means for tutors to gain a greater understanding of what a student is trying to do and hence put tutors in a better position to give appropriate feedback.",MT248,"The module aims to:  Enable students to be familiar with the concept of statistical modelling and be able to put this into practise by fitting simple linear regression models.

TM351,Data management and analysis,8,"Data management and analysis (TM351)  an overview of the concepts, techniques, and tools of modern data management and analysis. The requirements of data management continually evolve.  Recently those requirements have surpassed the capabilities of traditional data management.  So, in order to better prepare our graduates for the new demands of the job market, it is necessary to address both the traditional concepts of data management as well as the increasingly important area of data analytics.",M269 or M251,"This module aims to address some of the key concepts required for the traditionally important area of data management, and the increasingly important area of data analytics. The module will compare traditional relational databases with an alternate model (a NoSQL database), and will enable students to choose between the alternatives to select an appropriate means of storing and managing data, depending on the size and structure of a particular dataset and the use to which that data will be put. Students will be introduced to preliminary techniques in data analysis, starting from the position that data is used to answer a question, and introduced to a range of data visualisation and visual analysis techniques that will instil an understanding of how to start exploring a new data set.To ensure that students are comfortable with handling datasets, they will explore a range of openly licensed real-world datasets (either downloaded from their host websites, or provided as snapshots) to illustrate the key concepts in the course. Sources such as data.gov.uk, the World Bank, and a range of other national and international agencies will be used to provide appropriate data. The module will aim to divide approximately equally between issues in data management (technical and socio-legal issues in storing and maintaining datasets), and issues in data analytics (using data to answer questions). Students are not expected to have a background in statistics, but should be comfortable working with mathematical concepts and will need to be competent programmers.The module will be framed around a narrative that looks at how to manage and extract value and insight from a range of increasingly large data collections. At each stage, a comparison will be drawn between different ways of representing the data (for example, using different sorts of charts or geographical mapping techniques), and limitations of the mechanisms presented. To enable students to get a feel for the use of data, each stage will also include an overview of some data analysis techniques, including summary reporting and exploratory data visualisation. The module will be driven by Richard Hamming's famous quote: The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.Some of the key ideas are:Introducing data analysis. Starting with a text based data file such as comma separated variable (CSV) document, this unit will provide a brief introduction to some basic operations on simple data files. This will give an opportunity to provide an outline of the key ideas in the module, to ensure that the students have installed the module software correctly, and to begin to familiarise themselves with that software.Concepts in data management. The module will look at three key areas in data management: data architectures and data access (CRUD), data integrity, and transaction management (ACID). Each of these will be illustrated using a relational database, and one non-relational alternative, and the advantages and limitations of each model discussed.Legal and ethical issues. The module will consider the legal and ethical issues involved in managing data collections. Students will be required to obtain and read (parts of) the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and demonstrate how these apply to issues in data management. They will also consider privacy, ownership, intellectual property and licensing issues in data collection, management, retrieval and reuse.Concepts in data analytics. These sections will focus on using data to answer a real question; the focus will be on exploratory techniques (such as visualisation) and formulating a question into a form which can realistically be answered using the data that is available. Issues in processing techniques for large and real-time streamed data collections will also be addressed along with techniques and technologies (such as mapreduce) for handling them. This part will use a statistical package such as the python scientific libraries and/or ggplot to visualise the data and carry out appropriate analyses. It is not anticipated that students will need to understand statistical methods in depth.","A.
